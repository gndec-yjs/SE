### **Guidelines for Design:**
- Use IS 456:2000 for design guidelines.
- Consider appropriate factors for different exposure conditions (mild, moderate, severe).
- Include step-by-step calculations, diagrams, and assumptions made during the design process.
- Use Fe 415 steel for reinforcement and appropriate grade of concrete based on exposure conditions.
