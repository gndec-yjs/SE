1. Define a structure and explain what constitutes a structure in civil engineering. (2 Marks)  

2. List and describe the various types of structures commonly encountered in civil engineering. Also, provide examples of each type of structure mentioned. (4 Marks)

3. a) What is a load in the context of structural engineering? Explain the different types of loads that can act on a structure. (4 Marks)  
   b) Discuss the importance of correctly assessing loads in the design process. (4 Marks)

4. Explain the basic principles of structural analysis. Also, describe the concept of equilibrium in structures. (4 Marks) 

5. a) Define the concept of a load path in structural engineering. Why is the selection of an appropriate load path important in the design of structures?  (2 Marks) 
   b) Illustrate with a diagram the load path in a simple beam structure. (2 Marks)

6. What is redundancy in structural systems? (2 Marks) 

7. Compare and contrast determinate and indeterminate structures, providing examples of each. (4 Marks)

8. State Mohr's Theorem I and II. (2 Marks) 

9. a) Define a conjugate beam.  (2 Marks) 
   b) State both the conjugate beam theorems. (2 Marks) 

10. Define a primary structure (or released structure, or basic determinate structure). Draw all possible primary structures for a propped cantilever.
