| 1          | Differentiate between a one-way slab and a two-way slab.                                                   | 2        | L2            |
| 2          | Explain why distribution steel is placed above the main steel in slabs.                                    | 4        | L2            |
| 3          | List the purpose of providing distribution steel in reinforced concrete slabs.                             | 4        | L1            |
| 4          | Enlist and explain the steps involved in designing a one-way slab.                                         | 5        | L2            |
| 5          | Design a simply supported slab for a classroom of size 4 m x 8 m. The slab is supported on 230 mm thick masonry walls and is subjected to a live load of 4 kN/m² and surface finish of 1 kN/m². Use M20 concrete and Fe 415 steel. The exposure condition is mild, and there is no fire hazard. Draw a neat sketch illustrating the reinforcement details.  | 5, 6     | L4, L5        |
| 6          | Design a simply supported RCC slab to carry a factored load of 15,000 N/m², including its own weight, over an effective span of 3.1 m. Use M20 concrete and Fe 415 steel. Draw a neat sketch illustrating the reinforcement details. | 5, 6     | L4, L5        |
                                                                                                                                           |          |               |

### **Guidelines for Design:**
- Use IS 456:2000 for design guidelines.
- Include step-by-step calculations, diagrams, and assumptions made during the design process.
